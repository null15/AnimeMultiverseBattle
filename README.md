# Anime Multiverse Battle

### Description:
5v5 Anime Map, featuring characters from multiple franchises. It is a mix of Arena, Moba, Objectives, Tournament, Events and some. It aims to bring something new and fresh.
You win not by destroying the enemy base, but by the amount of points your team is able to accumulate by doing various activities around the map.

Some activity we plan to add are (but not limited to):

1. Everyone, together, teleports to a "Boss" area. Unable to damage each other, and the more damage a team does to a boss, the more their contribution points will increase.
2. A designated zone gets chosen and after a certain time has passed, players are unable to enter said zone. Whichever team is last standing on it wins points for that objective.
3. Similar to above, a designated zone gets chosen, and after a certain amount of time it becomes capturable. The longer a team holds the zone, the more points their team will earn.

You also earn Points from killing the enemy heroes, winning tournaments that are held after some time and some other events not listed.
