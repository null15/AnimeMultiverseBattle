# Hero Kit – Zoro

**Franchise:** One Piece
**Role/Tags:** Carry / Melee / Strenght
**Resource:** HP / Mana

## G - Swordmaster’s Rhythm
- Every time zoro lands abilities or basic attacks in quick succession, he builds **Rhythm** stacks.
- At max stacks, his next ability is empowered.
- **Q:** Dashes farther.
- **W:** Double-triggers.
- **E:** Tornado lasts longer.
- **R:** Grants a large amount of crit chance.

## Q - Oni Giri
- Zoro dashes forward with his signature three-sword slash.
- If zoro hits a hero, **Oni Giri** can be recast within 3 seconds for a second, stronger slash.

## W - Asura: Ghostly Aura
- **Passive:** Each time zoro lands 3 consecutive basic attacks, his **“Asura”** aura manifests, he gets attack damage for a few seconds.
- **Active:** Zoro projects an illusionary 9-sword slash, dealing bonus damage on his next attack.

## E - Tatsumaki (Dragon Twister)
- Zoro spins, creating a massive tornado around him.
- Deals aoe damage over time, pulling nearby enemies slightly toward the center.
- If cast during **Asura** aura, the tornado becomes **Black Rope Dragon Twister**, dealing extra true damage to enemies with shields/barriers.

## R - King of Hell’s Resolve
- Zoro taps into his post-enma mastery.
- Zoro ignores a percentage of enemy armor for a duration.
- While active, basic attacks apply a bleed dot.

## T - Santoryu Ogi: Dead Man’s Game
- Zoro channels his ultimate three-sword finisher.
- After a brief wind-up, he performs a cross-shaped slash barrage in a large cone.
- Enemies below a certain **HP** threshold are executed.
- If used while **Asura** aura is active, the cone extends further and the execution threshold increases slightly.
