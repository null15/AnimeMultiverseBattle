# Hero Kit – Todoroki

## G - Temperature Balance
- Every ability shifts todoroki’s temperature gauge.
- **Ice skills (Q, E)** lower the gauge → If it gets too low, todoroki self-slows.
- **Fire skills (W, E)** raise the gauge → If it gets too high, todoroki takes self-burn damage.
- Using skills alternately balances the gauge, granting bonus **Intelligence** and very short cooldown reduction.

## Q - Ice Wave
- Todoroki releases a cone of ice forward.
- Deals damage and slows enemies hit.
- Creates a temporary **Ice Wall** that blocks pathing for a few seconds.
- If this ability collides with any type of **Water**, allies in the area are given a small shield.

## W - Flame Burst
- Todoroki blasts flames in an area, dealing damage.
- Enemies hit suffer a burn over time.
- If cast on enemies already slowed or rooted by ice, the burn ignites stronger.

- The trail deals mixed burn and frost damage over time.
- Enemies standing on the trail are both slowed and gradually burned.
- Allies standing on the trail are given a very small movement speed boost.
- If todoroki passes throught the **Ice Wall**, it crumbles dealing damage scalling with target's max **HP**.

## R - Phosphor

- Todoroki fires a straight-line beam of fire and ice that pierces all enemies.
- Deals high damage and increases enemies damage taken for a short time (values to be discussed).
- If this ability collides with **Ice Wall**, it melts and **Water** is spread around the area.

## T - Flashfire Cold Heatwave

- Enemies inside are first frozen briefly (stunned), then immediately ignited in a massive explosion.
- Allies inside the zone gain a small shield. 
- Allies inside the zone gain bonus attack speed.
