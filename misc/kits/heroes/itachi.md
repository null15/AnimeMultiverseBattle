## T - Izanami
- For 6–8 seconds, the target hero is caught in an illusion loop.
- Their movement is slowed heavily. If they move xxx steps they are taken back.
- Attacks are interrupted.
- Abilities dont cast (potentialy could cast but do nothing and go into cd, giga broken).
- At the end the target is stunned briefly.

## Interaction Idea
- The first time itachi and sasuke come near each other and both have a certain level (T unlock, and this instance is once only per game).
- They are sent to an illusionary dimension (the room where they fought in the anime).
- **Every time** itachi and sasuke are the only ones standing (everyone else is *dead*) and they come near each other, it sends them to the dimension.
