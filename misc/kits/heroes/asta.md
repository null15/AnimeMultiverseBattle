# Hero Kit – Asta

**Franchise:** Black Clover
**Role/Tags:** Tank / Bruiser / Melee / Strenght 
**Resource:** HP / Mana / Stacks

## G - Anti-Magic Flow
- Whenever asta or an ally negates a spell effect (via W reflect, E seal, or T form), asta gains **Anti-Magic** Stacks.
- Each stack grants bonus resistances.
- At max stacks, his next ability is empowered (wider slash, stronger reflect, or stronger seal).

## Q - Demon-Slayer Sweep
- Asta swings the massive demon-slayer sword in a wide arc.
- Enemy heroes hit lose a portion of buffs/shields.

## W - Demon-Destroyer Seal
- Asta strikes a target with the demon-destroyer sword, creating a sealing slash.
- Enemy hit is purged of buffs and receive a debuff: his damage dealt is reduced for a short duration.
- If cast on an ally, removes negative debuffs instead.

## E - Demon-Dweller Reflect
- **First cast:** Asta raises the demon-dweller sword. For 2 seconds, the next targeted spell that hits him is absorbed.
- **Second cast:** Fires back the absorbed magic as a ranged projectile (damage scales with absorbed strength).
- If no spell was absorbed, the recast sends a weaker shockwave.

## R - Black Asta
- Asta channels liebe’s anti-magic, entering his **Black Asta** form for a duration.
- Gains bonus movement speed, attack range, and damage reduction.
- Basic attacks fire anti-magic projectiles (short-range) that cancel enemy passives or damage reductions.
- While active, W (reflect) absorbs multiple projectiles instead of just one.

## T - Devil Union: Anti-Magic Overdrive
- Asta fully unites with liebe, entering **Devil Union** form for a short time.
- Gains massive **HP** shield scaling with **Strength**.
- **Q:** Wide aoe slash that also knocks back enemies.
- **W:** Reflects all spells in the area around asta instead of just one.
- **E:** Seal becomes aoe, stripping buffs from everyone in range.
- **R:** **Black Asta** automatically activates during **Devil Union**.
- Final hit of each ability deals true anti-magic damage (pierces shields only).
