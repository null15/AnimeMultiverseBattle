G - Misfortune Accumulation: Touma's terrible luck grows throughout the match. Touma gains 1 misfortune point every time he takes damage from enemy abilities. Once touma has enough points of misfortune, the next time he is dealt lethal damage, he becomes unkillable temporarily instead.
Q - Right Hand Swing: Basic punch that deals bonus damage to minions. Destroys any kind of  illusions(clones, wards, invisble traps,etc... Also invisible enemy heroes become visible). While touma is in "Unkillable" state, it becomes a dragon head and deals bonus damage.
W - Imagine Breaker Touch: Touches the target enemy, silencing them for 2 seconds and dispelling all their buffs.
E - Protective Instinct (Touman): Guards target ally for 4 seconds, making them invulnerable (they cannot move or perform any action).
R - Lecture Mode ( touma's nonsense): Aoe dmg taunt - forces all nearby enemies to attack touma for xxx seconds while reducing damage taken.
T - Magic God's Assistance: Othinus appears and casts a massive nuke at target location. Damage scales with touma's max hp. If performed while touma is in "Unkillable" state, silences enemies for 3 seconds.
Upgraded T idea - Only while in unkillable state, after the initial crash of the nuke, enemies caught in it are sent to a dimension alongside touma:
    -Point Unknown: Touma cannot perform abilities, nor use items. Magic god Othinus herself assists touma in this dimension. Othinus has its own spells to battle the enemies. (she's not player controllable).
    -If othinus is defeated, everyone inside returns to the original world.
