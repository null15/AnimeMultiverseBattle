# Hero Kit â€“ Touma Kamijou

**Franchise:** Toaru Series
**Role/Tags:** Tank / Melee / Strenght 
**Resource:** HP / Mana / Gauge

## G - Misfortune Accumulation
- Touma's terrible luck grows throughout the match. Touma gains 1 misfortune point every time he takes damage from enemy abilities.
- Once touma has enough points of misfortune, the next time he is dealt lethal damage, he becomes **Unkillable** temporarily instead.

## Q - Right Hand Swing
- Basic punch that sends an air wave. 
- Destroys any kind of  illusions(clones, wards, invisible traps,etc).
- Also invisible enemy heroes become visible. 
- While touma is in "**Unkillable**" state, it becomes a dragon head and deals bonus damage.

## W - Imagine Breaker Touch
- Touches the target enemy, silencing them for 2 seconds and dispelling all their buffs.

## E - Protective Instinct (Touman)
- Guards target ally for 4 seconds (or other value), making them invulnerable (they cannot move or perform any action).

## R - Lecture Mode ( touma's nonsense)
- Aoe dmg taunt - forces all nearby enemies to attack touma for xxx seconds.
- Reduces damage taken.

## T - Magic God's Assistance
- Othinus appears and casts a massive nuke at target location. 
- Damage scales with touma's **max hp**. 
- If performed while touma is in "**Unkillable**" state, silences enemies for 3 seconds.

## Upgraded T idea
- Only while in **Unkillable** state, after the initial crash of the nuke, enemies caught in it are sent to a dimension alongside touma.
- **Point Unknown**: Touma cannot perform abilities, nor use items. Magic god Othinus herself assists touma in this dimension. 
- Othinus has its own spells to battle the enemies. (she's not player controllable).
- If othinus is defeated, everyone inside returns to the original world.
